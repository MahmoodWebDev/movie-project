## Movie Project

This project is a front-end task focused on retrieving movie information. At first glance, you are greeted with just a search bar. As you start typing, suggestions automatically appear, thanks to the implementation of debouncing. Pressing the enter key after your search triggers the display of a collection of movies. Each movie is showcased in a simple yet stylish card that reveals basic details. For more information, simply click on a movie card, and a detailed drawer will emerge. Additionally, if you click on a movie's image, it will open in a new tab, utilizing the provided link to the movie's poster.

To achieve a clean and elegant look while adhering to best practices, I have utilized the Material UI library.
