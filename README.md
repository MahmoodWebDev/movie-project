## Movie Project

This is a coding challenge done by Mahmood shah on 20th and 21st Jan 2024.

This project is a front-end task focused on retrieving movie information. Initially, you'll notice only a search bar. When you start typing, suggestions appear automatically, I used debouncing here. Pressing the enter key after searching will display a collection of movies. Each movie is presented in a simple, stylish card that shows only basic details. Clicking on a movie card reveals more information in a drawer. If you click on a movie's image, it will open in a new tab using the link provided for the movie's poster.

I have used Material UI library in order to give it a clean and elegant touch as well maintaining the best practices.
